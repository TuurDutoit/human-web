# The Human Web
Making the web more human, one link at a time

## Introduction
We’re used to everything being accessible at the click of button, a Google search or a PayPal checkout. Everything has to be fast, instantaneous, NOW. If we can’t get it NOW, what’s the point?

I want to step away from that. I like exploring, experimenting, trying; often without success, but with a valuable lesson learned, nonetheless. And I’d like to extend that philosophy into my work: I want to make fun, original experiences, that aren’t focused on easy and fast processing; I want to force the user to take some time, relax end enjoy exploring whatever I made. That doesn’t have to be unpleasant, though: the world is, almost by definition, chaotic and inefficient, just like we, humans. Taking that away doesn’t make experiences more pleasant, I’d argue it makes us lose our identity. We can’t possibly feel at home in a world run and created by computers, algorithms and maths. Why do you think AI and conversation-based interfaces are so popular right now? They are ways of making the Web, and all technology connected to it, more human. Finally, we can interact not just with buttons on a touchscreen, but with an entity that kinda thinks like us. After 50 years of research, enormous breakthroughs and trying to break Moore’s law, our technology is finally on the same level as we are. We made a conversation partner, a secretary, a buddy. We made our equal.

That is, I think, what most technology (and, actually, businesses and people, too) are missing these days: a sort of human touch or warmth. Something that compels us, that piques our interest. THAT is what this is. A bunch of links to things that make the web more human.
